JRPG Battle Engine conversion of the Zodiac RPG system created by S. Furguson

The rules can be found at http://zodiac-ffrpg.wikidot.com/

HERO/MONSTER MAKERS
Simple creator scenes can be found in the project folder. They must be opened manually in the Godot editor and played via the Play Current Scene button.
The feature list is far from complete, but new things are being added to it.

BATTLE PROTOTYPE INSTRUCTIONS
Actors act in order of initiative. Monsters do not attack (they wiggle) yet.
When it's one of your heros' turn to act, click Fight at the bottom of the screen and click on the name of the monster to target.
Monsters will lose HP, but do not die when they hit 0.
